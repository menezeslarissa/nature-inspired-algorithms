## Introduction

Nature-inspired algorithms are computational methods that mimic the behavior of natural systems or phenomena to solve complex problems. These algorithms are often inspired by biological, physical, or ecological processes and have been successfully applied in various fields, including optimization, machine learning, and data mining.

This repository aims to provide implementations of popular nature-inspired algorithms in Python, along with relevant examples and documentation. The algorithms included in this project are designed to serve as a resource for students that, as me, are starting their adventures in computer science. Most of the problems and examples were proposed by my professor, [Fabricio Breve](https://www.fabriciobreve.com/), for his course on "Nature-Inspired Computing".

## Algorithms

The repository currently includes the following nature-inspired algorithms:

- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- Firefly Algorithm (FA)

Each algorithm is implemented as a separate Python script, along with a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) demonstrating its usage and showcasing its application on a specific problem. The code is extensively documented to provide insights into the underlying principles and the algorithm's functioning.

## Getting Started

To use the algorithms in this repository, you need to have access to Google Colaboratory, an online cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nature-inspired-algorithms.git
```

2. Open Google Colaboratory in your web browser.

3. Click on **File > Open Notebook** and select **Upload**.

4. Upload the desired algorithm's Jupyter notebook file (e.g., `firefly_algorithm.ipynb`) from the cloned repository.

5. Once the notebook is opened, you can run the code cells sequentially to see the algorithm in action and modify the parameters or problem setup as needed.
